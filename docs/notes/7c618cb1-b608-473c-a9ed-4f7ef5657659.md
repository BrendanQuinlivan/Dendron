# Druid

Ever since the god Clay shaped the world, you and the brothers and sisters of your order have been tasked with safeguarding nature. You maintain the balance of the world. Your hand can be gentle or cruel, depending on what the situation requires, but you always act with respect and exercise judgment. You hold the forces of nature in your hands â€“ the earth, the weather, the plants and the animals all listen to your voice. You are a Druid.

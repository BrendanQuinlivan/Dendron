# The Artisan

You are truly skilled at a particular craft or activity, to the point were you set up a business in your settlement. You could make a living off of it, but not very well. While your love for your craft has not died, the lifting of the Blood Mist has made you realise that a quiet existence isn't for you.
_What are you doing with your craft now that you've left your settlement?_

- **Skills:** +1 Manipulation, +1 Crafting
- **Talent:** Bowyer, Builder, Chef, Tailor, or Tanner

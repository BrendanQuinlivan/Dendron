# Publish and share your own website for free with GitHub

## Struggle with complex and pricey web hosting no-mo!

[![Scott Vinkle](https://miro.medium.com/fit/c/56/56/2*xc4MU4FHwc_iigu3_wy47w.jpeg)](https://medium.com/@svinkle?source=post_page-----2eff049a1cb5--------------------------------)

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is not only a great place to store and share your code with others but they also offer free web hosting of your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript projects!

In this article I’ll show you how to get setup in order to publish and share your own [static HTML website](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page) on GitHub using the [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) app! 🚀

First thing’s first: [get yourself a GitHub account](https://github.com/join)! You won’t have access to the free hosting or any other awesome features GitHub has to offer without one.

The GitHub homepage with signup form to the right of the screen. Along the top is the main navigation area. To the left of the screen text reads, “Built for developers” with a description of what GitHub is all about.

With a GitHub account you’ll also be able to chat with other web developers, such as yourself, through Issues, and [contribute to other open source projects](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/searching-for-your-goldilocks-issue-f23b3a718de)!

This is the app that we’ll use to get our code up on GitHub. It’s easy to use so don’t fret; the user interface is easy to learn!

The GitHub Desktop homepage with a “Download for macOS” link, along with a Windows link. Along the top is the main navigation area. In the middle of the screen text reads, “The new native” with a description of what GitHub Desktop is all about.

- [Download GitHub Desktop for **macOS**](https://central.github.com/deployments/desktop/desktop/latest/darwin)
- [Download GitHub Desktop for **Windows**](https://central.github.com/deployments/desktop/desktop/latest/win32)

(If these links don’t work, explore the [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) homepage.)

Open the downloaded application file and continue through the installation process as required with your computer’s operating system.

Next, we’ll be creating a new GutHub project!

Before we upload our code to GitHub we first need to make GitHub Desktop aware of our project files. We do this by creating a new _Repository_ folder, then _copy_ our website files to this new folder.

**3.1 —** Open up the GitHub Desktop app and click the **“Create New Repository”** _button_.

![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/804/1*g2Zobde8Do0nJRTXN_eycg.png)

The “Create New Repository” button. Above, text reads, “Create a new project and publish it to GitHub”

**3.2 —** When the “Create a New Repository” dialog window appears, fill in the **“Name”** _text input_ as:

\[username].github.io

> Replace _\[username]_ with your GitHub account username.

**Note:** It’s very important to name your repository in this manner; this will tell GitHub to host the files in this project automatically and display them when someone points their browser to:

https&#x3A;//\[username].github.io/

This will be the web address you will share when your site is ready to publish and go live!

**3.3 —** The **“Local Path”** _text input_ is where your repository will live on your computer; this is **not** where your website files currently reside on your computer’s hard drive. GitHub Desktop needs to create a new, empty folder.

We’ll need to copy your site files over later, but for now, select a folder such as `/Sites` in your home folder. This will create a new folder inside the `/Sites` folder with the name of your repository, which will look like:

/Sites/\[username].github.io

![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/1732/1*sqPx-566C0S4uk1Zp3_DFA.png)

The “Create a New Repository” dialog window. Form controls include, “Name”, “Local Path”, “Initialize this repository with a README”, “Git Ignore”, and “License”. Two action controls at the bottom are labelled, “Cancel” and “Create Repository”.

**3.4 —** Leave all the other options in the form at their default settings and click the **“Create Repository”** _button_. For now we just want to create the folder which GitHub Desktop will recognize as a folder it can work with. For the sake of the guide, let’s describe this new folder as your _GitHub Repository_ folder.

After your _GitHub Repository_ folder has been created by clicking the **“Create Repository”** _button_, the GitHub Desktop app should look something like this:

![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/4288/1*K-hGAQLyegVwhQVPHWfccQ.png)

The GitHub Desktop app with an empty repository folder. Along the top are option controls for “Current Repository”, “Current Branch”, and “Publish repository”. The left side includes a space for a listing of files, a “Summary” text input, a “Description” text box, and a “Commit to master” button.

Let’s say up until now you’ve been working on your website in a folder located at `/Documents/my-site`; we’ll describe this as your _working folder_. Within this _working folder_ there’s probably some files and folders named `index.html`, `/css`, or `/javascript`. What we need to do is copy _everything_ from the _working folder_ over to our new _GitHub Repository_ folder.

In the previous step, we created the _GitHub Repository_ folder inside the `/Sites` folder with the name, `[username].github.io`. So, this means the _GitHub Repository_ folder should be located at `/Sites/[username].github.io`.

**4.1 —** Copy everything in your _working folder_ (`/Documents/my-site` for example) into your _GitHub Repository_ folder (`/Sites/[username].github.io`).

The GitHub Desktop app should now look something like this:

![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/4288/1*M020yo66fYAYy6Lj0XJC6Q.png)

The GitHub Desktop app, now displaying the added files on the left side bar and the text of the highlighted file in the main section of the app.

With all our files in the _GitHub Repository_ folder, we’re ready to **commit** our files!

> To “_commit”_ files means to take a “snapshot” of the files and folders in their current state. By doing so, we get them ready to be _pushed_ up to a repository on GitHub.

**4.2 —** Before we commit our files for publishing, we first need to tell GitHub what this commit is all about. Fill in the **“Summary”** _text input_, located near the bottom left of the user interface, with a high-level title of what this commit entails; something simple like, _“My first commit! 😀”_ works just fine in this instance.

Optionally, you can add more details about the commit in the **“Description”** _text box_. Usually you’d want to include things like what changed; maybe you fixed a bug or added some new content. It’s great to have these notes available for other developers or even _future you_ to make sure you know _why_ you made those changes oh so long ago!

Once the “Summary” and optional “Description” fields are filled out to your liking, click the **“Commit to master”** _button_!

After clicking the **“Commit to master”** _button_ in the previous step, you may be wondering:

> What just happened? My files are gone and the app is empty now!

**Don’t fret!** In the bottom left corner of the GitHub Desktop interface there’s a little indicator that your commit was successful.

![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/1068/1*e7su_cuM4YcWUXT88Foh1Q.png)

Under the “Commit to master” button displays recent commit messages, each with an “Undo” button to undo the recent commit.

Now that our files are _committed,_ this allows us to **push** our commit to GitHub!

> To “push” files means to upload the committed files in their current state to a repository on GitHub.

**5.1 —** Find the **“Publish repository”** _button_ along the top of the GitHub Desktop interface.

![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/988/1*_Cy89mk2ZRAxWiXI3iErKQ.png)

The “Publish repository” button, found along the top bar of the GitHub Desktop user interface. Text below the main label reads, “Publish this repository to GitHub”.

Go ahead and **click** this to send your files to GitHu…

**Oh wait**, we haven’t _logged in to GitHub_ from within the GitHub Desktop app yet! Let’s do that, first…

_\*record scratch\*_

**5.05 —** When the “Publish Repository” dialog window appears after clicking the **“Publish repository”** _button_, it will first prompt you to sign-in to GitHub if you haven’t yet already.

Click the **“Sign In”** _button_ to show the “Sign In” dialog window; fill in your Username and Password and click the **“Sign In”** _button_ to complete the process. You should now be logged in and good to proceed!

![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/1744/1*J1bI0-TNH_lRHXBEgZAhHA.png)

The “Sign In” dialog window featuring a “Username or email address” and “Password” text inputs. A link to optionally “Sign in using your browser” is also available. Two action controls at the bottom are labelled, “Cancel” and “Sign In”.

**5.1, take 2 —** Now that we’re signed in to GitHub, go ahead and click the **“Publish repository”** _button_ to begin the upload process.

**5.2 —** The “Publish Repository” dialog window will appear with a last few options for you to choose from before placing your website live.

All the options in the form are fine as-is except the **“Keep this code private”** _checkbox_; this needs to be _unchecked_ in order for you to share your site with friends and family.

An animated graphic of the “Publish Repository” dialog window. A computer mouse cursor moves in and sets the “Keep this code private” as unchecked. Other controls include, “Name”, “Description”, and “Organization”. Two action controls at the bottom are labelled, “Cancel” and “Publish Repository”.

**5.3 —** Click the **“Publish Repository”** _button_ to send your files up to GitHub!

Now, in your browser, go to your new GitHub repository page to make sure your files made the journey to their new home:

<https://github.com/\[username\]/\[username\].github.io>

Are all your files present and accounted for? Good! Nice job! 👍

The very last step is to get excited and check out your website in your browser! Surf on over to:

https&#x3A;//\[username].github.io/

Your website should appear before your very eyes! ✨😄✨

# Sorcerer

Let them stare at you in fear and disgust. Let them shy away from you, afraid that your dark arts will infect them. They fear you, but they need you. Who else can force nature itself to bend to their will? W ho else can make fire roar, water freeze and the earth shake? You, and only you, have seen what is beyond the veils of the world and stared into the inner core of existence. This insight is your burden to bear, so that others donâ€™t have to. You are a Sorcerer.
